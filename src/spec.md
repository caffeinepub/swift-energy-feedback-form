# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia) as a selectable UI language and provide complete Indonesian translations across the app.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new language dropdown option for Indonesian labeled “Bahasa Indonesia” with the 🇮🇩 flag and language code `id`.
- Extend the app’s `Language` type (and any related language configuration) to include `id`.
- Add a full Indonesian translation set for all existing UI translation keys so no components are missing `id` strings.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can choose “Bahasa Indonesia 🇮🇩” from the language menu and see the app’s UI text translated into Indonesian wherever translations are used.
