  "summary": "REQ-1 is partially implemented: the Indonesian option (code \"id\") was added to the language dropdown and the Language union type was extended to include \"id\". However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that a complete Indonesian (\"id\") translation dictionary was added for all existing translation keys.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Provide a full Indonesian translation entry for all existing translation keys used by the UI (language code \"id\").",
      "reason": "While the Language type now includes \"id\" and the selector includes Indonesian, the shown `translations` object excerpt only includes `en` and `hi` (then truncates). There is no visible evidence in the diff summary that an `id: { ... }` translation block exists with all required keys, which is necessary to avoid missing-key runtime issues and satisfy the AC about fully translated UI labels/messages.",

        "frontend/src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx (truncated)",
